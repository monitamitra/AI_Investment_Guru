## Types of stock

1. Common stock
If you’re new to investing in stock and looking to buy a few shares, you likely want to invest in common stock, which is exactly what the name suggests: the most common type of stock.
When you own common stock, you own a share in the company’s profits as well as the right to vote. Common stock owners may also earn dividends — a payment made to stock owners on a regular basis — but those dividends are typically variable and not guaranteed.

2. Preferred stock
The other main type of stock, preferred stock, is frequently compared to bonds. It typically pays investors a fixed dividend. Preferred shareholders also get preferential treatment: Dividends are paid to preferred shareholders before common shareholders, including in the case of bankruptcy or liquidation.
Preferred stock prices are less volatile than common stock prices, which means shares are less prone to losing value, but they’re also less prone to gaining value. In general, preferred stock is best for investors who prioritize income over long-term growth.

Within those broad categories of common and preferred, different types of stocks are further divided in other ways. Here are some of the most common:

3. Large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks
You might’ve heard the words large-cap or mid-cap before; they refer to market capitalization, or the value of a company. 

Companies are generally divided into three buckets by size: Large cap (market value of $10 billion or more), mid-cap (market value between $2 billion and $10 billion) and small-cap (market value between $300 million and $2 billion).

4. Sector stocks
Companies can also be classified into sectors based on what their core business is. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors:

- Energy
- Materials
- Industrials
- Consumer discretionary
- Consumer staples
- Health care
- Financials
- Information technology
- Communication
- Utilities
- Real estate

Stocks in the same sector — for example, the technology or energy sectors — may move together in response to market or economic events. That’s why it’s a good rule of thumb to diversify by investing in stocks across sectors. (Just ask someone who held a portfolio of tech stocks during the dot-com crash.)

5. Domestic and international stocks
Stocks are frequently grouped by geographic location. 
You can diversify your investment portfolio by investing not only in companies that do business in the U.S., but also in companies based internationally and in emerging markets, which are areas that are poised for expansion. (Here’s more on how to invest in international stocks.)

6. Growth and value stocks
You might hear stocks described as growth or value. Growth stocks are from companies that are either growing quickly or poised to grow quickly. Investors are typically willing to pay more for these stocks, because they’re expecting bigger returns.
Value stocks are essentially on sale: These are stocks investors have deemed to be underpriced and undervalued. The assumption is these stocks will increase in price, because they’re either currently flying under the radar or suffering from a short-term event.

## Types of bonds

1. Corporate bonds
There are many types of corporate bonds, with varying interest rates, maturity dates and credit quality. Say you want to buy a corporate bond, which helps fund Corporation X’s operations. You, the investor, buy and receive a bond as a corporate IOU. In return, you get regular interest payments. 
The risk you take as an investor varies depending on the creditworthiness of the corporation, and unlike certain government bonds, is affected by inflation and rate hikes.
While corporate bonds may carry relatively more risk than a U.S. government bond, they are still generally less volatile than stocks. If a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated, bondholders are more likely than stockholders to receive part of their initial investment.
Corporate bonds are graded investment or non-investment grade. Non-investment grade bonds, or "junk bonds," are considered higher risk and earn higher returns than investment-grade bonds or U.S. government bonds. However, you also run a higher risk of default, or not getting your money back.

2. Municipal bonds, or munis
Local governments raise funds to improve public infrastructure like schools and roads by selling municipal bonds. Since an investment in a municipal bond is an investment in a public good, munis are a relatively safe investment that also receives tax breaks on the income earned from interest. 
Typically, no federal income tax is levied, and you may also benefit from state and local tax exemptions. Munis can be purchased through a broker, generally at a minimum of $5,000. While they offer more risk than a U.S. government bond, they also typically have higher yields.

3. U.S. government bonds and securities
Governments worldwide sell bonds and securities to print money, fund government spending and services and pay down debt. U.S. government and agency bonds and securities carry the "full faith and credit" guarantee of the U.S. government and are considered one of the safest investments. What that means: regardless of war, inflation or the state of the economy, the U.S. government pays back its bondholders. As such, they're considered a safe investment option.

The U.S. Treasury sells securities in the form of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. 

Treasury bills carry no interest (known as "zero coupon") and their maturities range from several days to 52 weeks. 

Treasury notes are fixed-income securities with maturities at two, three, five, seven and 10 years. 

Treasury bonds, also known as T-bonds, are long-term, fixed-income securities with terms from 10 to 30 years. 

Interest income from Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxes. These securities can be bought for a minimum of $100 through Treasury Direct or a broker.

# U.S. Savings Bonds and TIPS
Two of the most common types of U.S. savings bonds are I-bonds and Series EE Savings Bonds. I-bonds are a favorite safe investment vehicle, known for “virtually no credit and default risk,” according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Priced at $25, they’re an accessible investment choice for a new investor.

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, and STRIPS are U.S. government bonds protected against inflation and a low-risk investment choice for inflation-wary investors. The minimum price to invest is $100.
Agency securities are bonds issued by either federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises, known as GSEs.

The Government National Mortgage Association, also called GNMA or Ginnie Mae, is a U.S. federal agency whose debt is guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, agency securities carry virtually no risk.
GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are corporations the U.S. government created to address public concerns like affordable housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency securities have excellent credit, are low risk and offer higher yields than 
U.S. Treasurys and savings bonds.

Some agency securities, such as bonds that fund the Tennessee Valley Authority, have the benefit of being exempt from state and local taxes. While it does vary, the minimum price to invest in agency securities is $10,000, and they can be bought through a broker.

4. International and emerging markets bonds
The U.S. government is not the only country you can invest in. Like corporate bonds, there are many shades of international and emerging market bonds with varying interest rates, maturity dates and credit quality. However, since there is no international bond regulator, information can be harder to come by, meaning you may have to make a trade with incomplete information. 

“Sovereign risk” details the risk profile for a particular country and the likelihood that the country will default on its debt. Political and economic instability can affect the bond’s risk of default and whether your bond is repaid.

# Bond Funds
If you'd like to easily diversify your bond holdings, bond exchange-traded funds allow you to conveniently invest in a basket of bonds. Bond ETFs can offer a further layer of diversification within the bond asset class.
Socially conscious investors may also want to consider investment options like green bonds and other ESG funds. For investors who want to make returns and a difference, investment vehicles driven by environmental, social and governance principles are a growing option.
Green bonds, for instance, follow sustainability principles that include guidance on the use of proceeds, the process for project evaluation and selection, the management of proceeds and reporting.

## Types of REITs
Equity REITs: Most REITs operate as equity REITs, providing investors access to diverse portfolios of income-producing assets they would not be able to afford on their own. These real estate companies own properties in a range of real estate sectors that are leased to tenants, such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartment complexes and more. They distribute the bulk of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Learn more

mREITs: Mortgage REITs (mREITS) provide financing for income-producing real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and earning income from the interest on these investments. Learn more

PNLRs: Public non-listed REITs (PNLRs) are registered with the SEC but do not trade on national stock exchanges. Liquidity options vary and may take the form of share repurchase programs or secondary marketplace transactions but are generally limited. Learn more

Private REITs: Private REITs are real estate funds or companies that are exempt from SEC registration and whose shares do not trade on national stock exchanges. Private REITs generally can be sold only to institutional investors

## Types of Commodities 
# Crude Oil
If you have crude oil in mind, it helps to know what shapes prices and how you can invest in this commodity. After production, crude oil is refined into many different products, including gasoline that is used to fuel vehicles. But it goes beyond just gas. Products made from petroleum include plastics, medicines, linoleum, shingles, ink, cosmetics, synthetic fibers, solvents, fertilizer, asphalt, and thousands of others.
But what affects prices? Crude oil generally reacts to the laws of supply and demand. When demand exceeds supply, prices tend to rise. When demand wanes and supply remains fairly consistent, prices tend to fall. For instance, when gas is in high demand—say, during the summer driving season—the price at the pumps rises, translating into higher crude oil prices.
Similarly, demand from developing nations such as China and India—whose economies are still growing—is also pushing up prices. Geopolitics also has a big impact on the price of crude oil. Tensions in the Middle East, where much of the world's oil is produced, can send oil prices skyrocketing.

# How to Invest in Crude Oil
Investing in physical crude oil isn't as easy as investing in other commodities; you can't just buy a barrel of oil. As an investor, you may consider futures; the most direct method of owning the commodity outright. But futures can be highly volatile and need a good deal of capital. And they also require a great deal of knowledge, so it's not really a good option for novice investors.

Investors may consider purchasing stocks in oil companies, crude oil mutual funds, or even ETFs. These vehicles trade on exchanges just like stocks, so they're easy to come by. The U.S. Oil Fund is one example. It tracks the movement of West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude oil.
Other options include buying shares in mutual funds or energy sector ETFs, which invest directly in oil company stocks. These options tend to come with lower risks because they have more diversified offerings.

# Gold
The gold market boasts diversity and growth. It's used in jewelry, technology, by central banks, and investors, giving rise to its market at different times within the global economy. The precious metal has traditionally been a safe investment and a hedge against inflation. When the U.S. dollar goes down, you can bet gold prices will go up.
Just like crude oil, when there's an increase in demand, the same happens to the price of gold. Furthermore, prices are affected when central banks—which hold gold—decide to diversify their monetary reserves by buying more gold.

# How to Invest in Gold
Unlike crude oil, investors can take possession of the physical commodity. Investors who want to hold the physical commodity can do so by purchasing gold bullion bars or coins. But this means having to pay to store it in a deposit box, vault, or another safe place. Another option, just as you would for crude, is to go through the futures contract. Contracts require investors to deposit an initial margin. But again, there is a risk to this kind of investment. If the price rises, investors will profit; however, if the price drops, the investor stands to lose their money.

Stocks and ETFs, along with mutual fund options are plenty. With gold stocks, investors aren't just limited to producers but also to exploration and mining companies. As usual, it's a good idea for investors to do their homework and see what the operational risks are for each company. Gold ETFs, on the other hand, provide exposure to the precious metal while tracking its price. For instance, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF gives investors exposure to bullion without having to take possession of it.Silver often trades similarly to gold, but with a gold/silver price ratio that fluctuates over time.

# Base Metals
Base metals are common metals used in commercial and industrial applications, such as construction and manufacturing. Aluminum, zinc, and copper are good examples. They are relatively inexpensive, and supplies are generally stable because they're commonly found around the world.But because they are plentiful, prices tend to be much lower than they are for precious metals; however, the increase in the applications of base metals coupled with rising global demand—particularly from China and other developing nations—continues to positively impact prices.

# How to Invest in Base Metals 
Holding on to aluminum, zinc, and copper may not necessarily be very fruitful. Because of their low prices, investors would have to hold copious amounts of these commodities in order to profit.Instead, holding stocks in base metals companies like aluminum company Alcoa or a steel company like U.S. Steel is a great way to get a foot in the door. Furthermore, holding ETFs like the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF provides exposure to companies involved in metals and mining.


- promote growth by taking greater risks, including investing in growing industries. Portfolios focused on growth investments typically offer both higher potential rewards and concurrent higher potential risk. Growth investing often involves investments in younger companies that have more potential for growth as compared to larger, well-established firms.

more secure way of investing => more focused on securing regular income from investments as opposed to focusing on potential capital gains. An example is buying stocks based on the stock’s dividends rather than on a history of share price appreciation.

good for emergency funds => an investor takes advantage of buying cheap assets by valuation. They are especially useful during difficult economic times when many businesses and investments struggle to survive and stay afloat. Investors, then, search for companies with profit potential but that are currently priced below what analysis deems their fair market value to be. In short, value investing focuses on finding bargains in the market.
