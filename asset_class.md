## Types of stock

1. Common stock
If you’re new to investing in stock and looking to buy a few shares, you likely want to invest in common stock, which is exactly what the name suggests: the most common type of stock.
When you own common stock, you own a share in the company’s profits as well as the right to vote. Common stock owners may also earn dividends — a payment made to stock owners on a regular basis — but those dividends are typically variable and not guaranteed.

2. Preferred stock
The other main type of stock, preferred stock, is frequently compared to bonds. It typically pays investors a fixed dividend. Preferred shareholders also get preferential treatment: Dividends are paid to preferred shareholders before common shareholders, including in the case of bankruptcy or liquidation.
Preferred stock prices are less volatile than common stock prices, which means shares are less prone to losing value, but they’re also less prone to gaining value. In general, preferred stock is best for investors who prioritize income over long-term growth.

Within those broad categories of common and preferred, different types of stocks are further divided in other ways. Here are some of the most common:

3. Large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks
You might’ve heard the words large-cap or mid-cap before; they refer to market capitalization, or the value of a company. 

Companies are generally divided into three buckets by size: Large cap (market value of $10 billion or more), mid-cap (market value between $2 billion and $10 billion) and small-cap (market value between $300 million and $2 billion).

4. Sector stocks
Companies can also be classified into sectors based on what their core business is. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors:

- Energy
- Materials
- Industrials
- Consumer discretionary
- Consumer staples
- Health care
- Financials
- Information technology
- Communication
- Utilities
- Real estate

Stocks in the same sector — for example, the technology or energy sectors — may move together in response to market or economic events. That’s why it’s a good rule of thumb to diversify by investing in stocks across sectors. (Just ask someone who held a portfolio of tech stocks during the dot-com crash.)

5. Domestic and international stocks
Stocks are frequently grouped by geographic location. 
You can diversify your investment portfolio by investing not only in companies that do business in the U.S., but also in companies based internationally and in emerging markets, which are areas that are poised for expansion. (Here’s more on how to invest in international stocks.)

6. Growth and value stocks
You might hear stocks described as growth or value. Growth stocks are from companies that are either growing quickly or poised to grow quickly. Investors are typically willing to pay more for these stocks, because they’re expecting bigger returns.
Value stocks are essentially on sale: These are stocks investors have deemed to be underpriced and undervalued. The assumption is these stocks will increase in price, because they’re either currently flying under the radar or suffering from a short-term event.

## Types of bonds

1. Corporate bonds
There are many types of corporate bonds, with varying interest rates, maturity dates and credit quality. Say you want to buy a corporate bond, which helps fund Corporation X’s operations. You, the investor, buy and receive a bond as a corporate IOU. In return, you get regular interest payments. 
The risk you take as an investor varies depending on the creditworthiness of the corporation, and unlike certain government bonds, is affected by inflation and rate hikes.
While corporate bonds may carry relatively more risk than a U.S. government bond, they are still generally less volatile than stocks. If a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated, bondholders are more likely than stockholders to receive part of their initial investment.
Corporate bonds are graded investment or non-investment grade. Non-investment grade bonds, or "junk bonds," are considered higher risk and earn higher returns than investment-grade bonds or U.S. government bonds. However, you also run a higher risk of default, or not getting your money back.

2. Municipal bonds, or munis
Local governments raise funds to improve public infrastructure like schools and roads by selling municipal bonds. Since an investment in a municipal bond is an investment in a public good, munis are a relatively safe investment that also receives tax breaks on the income earned from interest. 
Typically, no federal income tax is levied, and you may also benefit from state and local tax exemptions. Munis can be purchased through a broker, generally at a minimum of $5,000. While they offer more risk than a U.S. government bond, they also typically have higher yields.

3. U.S. government bonds and securities
Governments worldwide sell bonds and securities to print money, fund government spending and services and pay down debt. U.S. government and agency bonds and securities carry the "full faith and credit" guarantee of the U.S. government and are considered one of the safest investments. What that means: regardless of war, inflation or the state of the economy, the U.S. government pays back its bondholders. As such, they're considered a safe investment option.

The U.S. Treasury sells securities in the form of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. 

Treasury bills carry no interest (known as "zero coupon") and their maturities range from several days to 52 weeks. 

Treasury notes are fixed-income securities with maturities at two, three, five, seven and 10 years. 

Treasury bonds, also known as T-bonds, are long-term, fixed-income securities with terms from 10 to 30 years. 

Interest income from Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxes. These securities can be bought for a minimum of $100 through Treasury Direct or a broker.

# U.S. Savings Bonds and TIPS
Two of the most common types of U.S. savings bonds are I-bonds and Series EE Savings Bonds. I-bonds are a favorite safe investment vehicle, known for “virtually no credit and default risk,” according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Priced at $25, they’re an accessible investment choice for a new investor.

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, and STRIPS are U.S. government bonds protected against inflation and a low-risk investment choice for inflation-wary investors. The minimum price to invest is $100.
Agency securities are bonds issued by either federal government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises, known as GSEs.

The Government National Mortgage Association, also called GNMA or Ginnie Mae, is a U.S. federal agency whose debt is guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, agency securities carry virtually no risk.
GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are corporations the U.S. government created to address public concerns like affordable housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency securities have excellent credit, are low risk and offer higher yields than 
U.S. Treasurys and savings bonds.

Some agency securities, such as bonds that fund the Tennessee Valley Authority, have the benefit of being exempt from state and local taxes. While it does vary, the minimum price to invest in agency securities is $10,000, and they can be bought through a broker.

4. International and emerging markets bonds
The U.S. government is not the only country you can invest in. Like corporate bonds, there are many shades of international and emerging market bonds with varying interest rates, maturity dates and credit quality. However, since there is no international bond regulator, information can be harder to come by, meaning you may have to make a trade with incomplete information. 

“Sovereign risk” details the risk profile for a particular country and the likelihood that the country will default on its debt. Political and economic instability can affect the bond’s risk of default and whether your bond is repaid.

# Bond Funds
If you'd like to easily diversify your bond holdings, bond exchange-traded funds allow you to conveniently invest in a basket of bonds. Bond ETFs can offer a further layer of diversification within the bond asset class.
Socially conscious investors may also want to consider investment options like green bonds and other ESG funds. For investors who want to make returns and a difference, investment vehicles driven by environmental, social and governance principles are a growing option.
Green bonds, for instance, follow sustainability principles that include guidance on the use of proceeds, the process for project evaluation and selection, the management of proceeds and reporting.
